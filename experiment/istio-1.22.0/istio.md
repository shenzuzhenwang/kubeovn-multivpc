## Istio Service Mesh

Istio is an open source service mesh platform designed to help manage and secure communications between microservice applications. It provides a unified way to control, monitor, and secure traffic between microservices, especially in large-scale distributed systems. 

We use Istio as a benchmark, and this folder is about the configuration method. 

In addition, because the binary file of Istio is too large to be put into the warehouse, it needs to be downloaded online.



#### Prerequisites

1. **Kubernetes clusters**: At least two clusters (either in different regions or on the same network) should be set up.
2. **Helm or istioctl**: Ensure that you have `istioctl` or Helm installed for Istio installation.
3. **kubectl**: Ensure `kubectl` is installed and configured to access your clusters.
4. **Istio CLI**: Download the latest `istioctl` CLI tool.

#### Step 1: Download and Install `istioctl`

Download `istioctl` based on your operating system:

```bash
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
```

After installation, add `istioctl` to your PATH:

```
export PATH=$PWD/istio-*/bin:$PATH
```

**Explanation**: This will download the Istio release and install `istioctl` to your local machine.

#### Step 2: Install Istio in the Primary Cluster

First, choose a configuration profile that suits your environment. You can install Istio using a default profile or a custom profile.

##### Install Using a Custom Profile

If you need to install Istio with a specific configuration, use the following command:

```
istioctl install --set profile=demo --set values.global.proxy.autoscaleEnabled=true
```

**Explanation**: This installs Istio with the `demo` profile and enables auto-scaling for proxies. You can replace `demo` with other profiles like `default`, `minimal`, or `custom` depending on your needs.

##### Install Using the Default Profile

To install Istio with the default settings:

```
istioctl install --set profile=default
```

**Explanation**: The `default` profile installs Istio with the most commonly used settings.

After installation, verify that Istio components are running:

```
kubectl get pods -n istio-system
```

**Explanation**: This ensures that the Istio control plane has been successfully deployed.

#### Step 3: Install Istio in the Second Cluster

Repeat the same process for the second cluster, but this time, you will use `istioctl` with a multi-cluster setup to enable cross-cluster communication.

1. Install Istio in the second cluster using the same profile:

```
istioctl install --set profile=default
```

2. Set the appropriate context for the second cluster in your `kubectl` configuration.

#### Step 4: Set Up the Multi-Cluster Configuration

Now, configure your clusters to communicate with each other in a multi-cluster setup.

##### Create the Shared Configuration in Cluster A (Primary)

To enable Istio multi-cluster, you need to create a **MultiPrimary** setup. First, create a `Multicluster` configuration in the primary cluster:

```
istioctl x create-remote-secret --name=cluster2- > cluster2-secret.yaml
```

This generates a remote secret file that you'll apply in the secondary cluster to establish a secure connection.

##### Apply the Remote Secret in Cluster B (Secondary)

In Cluster B, apply the generated secret:

```
kubectl apply -f cluster2-secret.yaml
```

This step ensures that Cluster A and Cluster B can communicate securely.

##### Set Up Service Discovery Across Clusters

Once the secret is applied, configure both clusters to allow service discovery across the two environments. Enable the **MultiPrimary** setup by using the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f istio-multi-cluster.yaml
```

This YAML file defines the multi-cluster configuration and sets up services to be discovered across both clusters.

#### Step 5: Verify Multi-Cluster Communication

To verify that the clusters are properly connected, you can test service communication by sending traffic from one cluster to another.

1. In Cluster A, deploy a test application:

```
kubectl apply -f test-app.yaml
```

2. Use `kubectl` to test accessing the service from Cluster B:

```
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- curl <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
```

**Explanation**: This will verify that Cluster A can access services running in Cluster B and vice versa.

#### Step 6: Clean Up the Multi-Cluster Configuration

If you want to delete the multi-cluster configuration and remove Istio, run:

```
kubectl delete -f istio-multi-cluster.yaml
```

You can also uninstall Istio from both clusters using `istioctl`:

```
istioctl uninstall --purge
```

**Explanation**: This command removes Istio from both clusters.
